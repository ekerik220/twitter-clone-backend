## What is Twatter

Twatter is a clone of Twitter. I'm trying to recreate Twitter as accurately as I can. I believe there is a lot to learn from imitation. It's easy to fall into the trap of only making things you already know how to make, and imitating an existing website forces you to make whatever is on that site, regardless of whether you currently know how to or not. Furthermore, it allows one to not spend time thinking about **what** to make, and **what** it should look like. Instead, one can focus efforts on learning **how** to make it, and **how** to make it look right.

Twatter has no affiliation with Twitter, and is being made as a learning project only.

## Back end

This is the repository for the back end of Twatter. You can find the front end [here](https://github.com/ekerik220/twitter-clone-frontend).

The back end is made using Apollo GraphQL and MongoDB.
